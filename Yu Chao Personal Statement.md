# Yu Chao's Personal Statement  
*Statement in response to defamatory accusations and public attacks*  

---

**My name is Yu Chao, and I am a former Falun Gong practitioner.** I am here to raise awareness about a critical aspect of the recent Falun Gong/Shen Yun controversy, in which I am both a whistleblower and a victim. **The key message I wish to convey is this: I am not a CCP agent**, and the revelation of Shen Yun's inner workings is not done under the direction or in cooperation with the Chinese Communist Party, as the Falun Gong authorities and media have claimed.

Before I go to the details, let me first give you a brief introduction to Falun Gong and Shen Yun.

Falun Gong is a spiritual group that has been banned and persecuted in China. Over the years, it has grown significantly outside China, expanding into various sectors, including media, entertainment, education, business, and technology. One of its most visible ventures is the Shen Yun Performing Arts company, known for its cultural shows.

Recently, *The New York Times* published a [series](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/15/nyregion/shen-yun-dance-abuse.html) of investigative articles uncovering allegations of child labor exploitation and psychological abuse within Shen Yun. These reports were mainly based on testimony from former Shen Yun performers because Shen Yun authorities turned down the NYT’s interview requests. In response, Falun Gong and its media arm, The Epoch Times, categorically denied the allegations, citing the positive experiences of current performers.

Following the reports, Falun Gong-affiliated groups alleged that former performers and individuals exposing the alleged abuses, like myself, were CCP agents or supporters of Beijing’s persecution of Falun Gong. **I have become a primary target of such accusations. Let me state unequivocally: I am not a CCP agent.**

**I have practiced Falun Gong for 31 years and spent nearly a decade in CCP prisons** for helping Western journalists document the persecution of Falun Gong practitioners and for teaching Falun Gong practitioners encryption methods. However, after moving to the United States, I was devastated to witness the corruption within Falun Gong and the exploitation of Shen Yun performers. This compelled me to step forward once again to reveal the truth.

**I have reported Shen Yun to the National Human Trafficking Hotline.** For more information on this issue, you can explore [my YouTube programs](https://x.com/Charleshvgo/status/1773318531775451591).

**To those who claim that I am an unregistered CCP agent, I offer this response: Falun Gong is lying, and the full story of Shen Yun will come out.** Here are detailed accounts of the facts about me that Falun Gong authorities and media have distorted.

On August 6, 2024, the Falun Dafa Information Center issued a report titled [Weaponizing Social Media: The CCP’s New Plan to ‘Eliminate’ Falun Gong Worldwide](https://faluninfo.net/weaponizing-social-media/) claiming that the Chinese regime has made a strategic decision to intensify its global persecution of Falun Gong. This strategy includes providing full support to social media influencers to attack Falun Gong and Shen Yun Performing Arts.

The article references two YouTubers, one from Japan and one from America, without naming them.

Although the report did not mention my name, **the description of the American YouTuber clearly pointed to me, Yu Chao.** The article claims I acted as an unregistered "foreign agent of the CCP" and alleges that I am supported by the Chinese Ministry of Public Security. It further states that I receive content from CCP officials and a network of overseas agents and spies within the Falun Gong community. Additionally, it suggests that the former Shen Yun performers I interviewed are "suspicious individuals" who might have connections with the CCP.

This report and its points have been cited by Falun Gong media outlets, including the Epoch Times, NTD TV, Sound of Hope, Zhengjian, Banned Book, Renminbao, Aboluowang, and Botanwang. Numerous Falun Gong influencers on social media provided substantial coverage, and it has also been cited by some other media outlets, such as Radio Free Asia.

**The accusation against me in the report is a complete and utter lie.**

As I mentioned earlier, I was imprisoned in China for almost 10 years for spreading information about the persecution of Falun Gong. I was released from prison in 2012, came to the United States in 2013, and am now a U.S. citizen.

Beginning in 2017, some former Shen Yun performers contacted me to share their traumatic experiences at Shen Yun. Upon hearing these stories, I reached out to Falun Gong authorities, veteran practitioners, and people who work at Fei Tian, the college that prepares dancers and musicians for Shen Yun, to verify these claims. However, no one gave me a straightforward answer; instead, they asked me not to spread or mention what I have heard.

**I did not comply.** Instead, I began sharing these stories and interviewing Shen Yun performers on my YouTube channel. **As a result, I was publicly criticized and demonized by Falun Gong’s official website, Minghui.org, and by Falun Gong founder Li Hongzhi.** I was officially excommunicated from Falun Gong, and practitioners were instructed not to watch, listen to, or have any contact with me.

**The Falundafa.info report had repeatedly accused me of being a CCP agent**, claiming I belong to an "extensive network of overseas agents."

However, **It is worth noting that this report was later revised several times.** In the latest version, they no longer claim we are CCP agents and erased the Japanese YouTuber from their report. **They instead put their sole focus on me** and said that my revelations were provided by the Chinese Communist Party. The Chinese Communist Party's institutions that suppress Falun Gong are fully supporting me. In addition, the report also implied that the former Shen Yun performers I introduced to the New York Times were "suspicious persons" with ties to the Chinese Communist Party. Because they have all returned to China and have some kind of connection or cooperation with the Beijing Dance Academy. In the description of the report, the Beijing Dance Academy is a tool of the Chinese Communist Party to persecute Falun Gong.

**I have no connection to the CCP.** I have not contacted any CCP personnel, received instructions from them, or accepted any funds from them. In fact, I have consistently maintained my anti-CCP stance.

The content of my programs was not provided by the CCP. **All the individuals I interviewed were former Shen Yun performers or musicians, many of whom grew up practicing Falun Gong.** They revealed to me the horrific practices within Shen Yun, including child slavery, child labor exploitation, human trafficking, arranged marriages or forced breakups, and the physical, mental, and spiritual abuse they endured.

**Labeling these individuals as suspicious and implying they have connections with the Communist Party is both unfair and dishonest.** These people are U.S., New Zealand, and Taiwanese citizens. Most of them grew up practicing Falun Gong. Shen Yun is fully aware of their identities and has pressured them through social connections. Some of them have family members still involved in Falun Gong who are forced to harass their own children under pressure from the organization.

To the best of my knowledge, these former Shen Yun performers’ connection with the Beijing Dance Academy is nothing more than a simple visit and a chat about dance techniques with some of the dance instructors, who did not know that they were former Falun Gong practitioners or Shen Yun performers. These former Shen Yun performers did not have any contact or received any instructions from the Chinese government. I believe they will make this point clear in various ways in the near future.

That said, I've noticed that there are many seemingly machine-generated comments in support of me on my Twitter and YouTube channels, which I have massively blocked. I believe these are posted by the Chinese Communist Party's '50 Cent Army.' **While I think the CCP might exploit any facts or statements that are unfavorable to Falun Gong to attack the movement, this in no way implies that I have any connection with them.**

**The report described me as someone who "desires to be part of a 'death squad' against Shen Yun and U.S. law enforcement issued a warning to local officials in New York that he was 'potentially armed and dangerous' after he was seen near the Shen Yun training center."**

**This account is completely false.** In early September 2023, when Shen Yun claimed that I was seen near their campus, I was actually on a getaway in Toledo, Ohio, 536 miles away from Shen Yun’s location—and **I did NOT have any weapons with me.** At that time, I became aware that high-ranking Falun Gong members were searching for my physical address. Given that Shen Yun performers had previously shared with me accounts of multiple suspicious deaths related to Shen Yun, I thought it wise to distance myself from potential danger and reported my concerns to the local police during that trip. **No, I was not near Shen Yun at that time; in fact, by then I had never been within 90 miles of their campus in my entire life.**

Unfortunately, the FBI believed these lies—both the mistranslation of "death squad" and the claim that I was near the campus. As a result, they issued a security bulletin throughout Berkshire County and searched my home with local police.

**Falun Gong tracked down my address, causing me to fear for my safety. Shen Yun twisted my words and misled U.S. federal law enforcement agencies in an attempt to silence me. But I will not be silenced.**

**The fact that the entire report is a blatant lie and that it is widely cited by both Falun Gong-controlled and non-Falun Gong-controlled media is deeply concerning.** When I began revealing the truth about Shen Yun, I faced a massive organization alone. **I did not back down then, just as I did not back down when the CCP first began persecuting Falun Gong over 20 years ago.** While my circumstances have changed, **my commitment to the truth has not.**

**Being persecuted in one area does not justify wrongdoing elsewhere. Everyone has the right to know the full story of Shen Yun.**
