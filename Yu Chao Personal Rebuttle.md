# Yu Chao's Personal Rebuttal  
*Statement in response to defamatory accusations and public attacks*  

---

## Who I Am  

**I am Yu Chao, a survivor of nine years of unjust imprisonment in China for defending my faith in Falun Gong.**  
I have stood for Truthfulness, Compassion, and Forbearance — not in words alone, but through sacrifice and suffering.

After arriving in the United States, I continued to uphold these values, contributing actively to the community.

## Why I Spoke Out  

I came to learn, through courageous former Shen Yun performers, of **deep abuses within the Shen Yun organization — abuses including harm to minors, who had no voice to defend themselves.**  

> *Their testimonies stirred my conscience. I could not remain silent while others were harmed under the cover of a movement I once served and trusted.*

## The Retaliation  

As soon as I began questioning Shen Yun and Minghui, a relentless campaign of retaliation was unleashed:  

- **Social ostracism**  
- **Public defamation** through community channels  
- **Erasure** of my past contributions and identity  
- **Emotional and psychological harm**  

## The Legal Attack  

In September 2023, a malicious false report led to an FBI raid on my home — a direct result of this orchestrated retaliation.  

Now, I face a federal firearms charge arising from that raid — a legal threat designed not to seek justice, but to destroy me.  

## My Stand  

> *I will not be silenced.*  

> *I will continue to speak for those who cannot speak, and to defend truth against coercion and abuse.*  

**No person should face destruction for exercising conscience.**  

**I stand not for myself alone, but for all who resist silence in the face of oppression.**
